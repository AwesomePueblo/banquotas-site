What ostensibly began as a protest against U.S. or Israeli actions quickly became a <em>“breeding ground” for open antisemitism, the glorification of terrorism, and dangerous incitements to violence</em>:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. Independent journalist Nate Friedman attended and documented this demonstration in a viral exposé video titled <strong><em>“I Exposed More Iran ‘Protestors’.”</em></strong> His on-the-ground interviews captured shocking statements from participants and led to the discovery that some demonstrators were in fact organized, repeat agitators rather than ordinary grassroots protesters.</p> <p>Friedman’s investigation builds on earlier efforts to expose professional activists infiltrating protests. In this report, we summarize the key findings: first, the extreme anti-Israel and pro-terror rhetoric openly expressed by rally-goers, and second, evidence that a network of paid or professional protesters helped orchestrate and amplify the event. These findings raise serious questions about the nature of such protests and who is really behind them.</p> </details> <details id="antisemitism"> <summary>Antisemitic Rhetoric at the Protest</summary> <p>Friedman’s footage reveals that what was framed as an anti-war or “pro-Iran” rally quickly descended into unabashed calls for violence against Israel and praise for militant groups. In one jarring exchange caught on video, he asks a protester, “Do you want to see Israel destroyed?” – to which she immediately answers, “Yes”:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. She then doubles down, saying she is “<em>thrilled</em>” by Iran’s regime because it is “the only country that stands up to Israel and will hopefully destroy it”:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. This chilling admission set the tone for many conversations.</p> <p>Multiple demonstrators defended Iran and openly celebrated its terrorist proxies. Interviewees praised groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, even justifying Hamas’s infamous October 7 massacre of Israeli civilians as legitimate “resistance”:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. At one point, protesters chanted slogans such as <strong>“Iran make us proud, burn Tel Aviv to the ground”</strong>:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}, explicitly endorsing the destruction of Israel’s largest city. The rally also featured members of Neturei Karta (an extreme anti-Zionist Jewish sect) brandishing signs in support of Iran’s regime:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}, underscoring the convergence of disparate anti-Israel factions at the event.</p> <p>Far from being a peaceful call for dialogue, the demonstration became an outlet for extremist rhetoric. Participants cheered for an outcome in which Israel would be wiped out – rhetoric indistinguishable from that of Iran’s hardline ayatollahs. As one observer noted, protestors on American soil felt free to openly call for Israel’s destruction while excusing (or even celebrating) the mass murder of Jews:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}. These statements illustrate how anti-Israel activism can serve as a thin veil for virulent antisemitism and support for terrorism, rather than a genuine critique of policy. The line between “anti-Zionism” and outright Jew-hatred was repeatedly crossed at this rally.</p> </details> <details id="protesters"> <summary>Professional Protesters Exposed</summary> <p>Beyond the shocking content of the protesters’ words, Friedman’s investigation uncovered something equally insidious: the presence of professional agitators who travel from rally to rally. Partway through his interviews, a woman aggressively intervened – attempting to shout him down and prevent protesters from answering his questions. Suspicious of her behavior, Friedman dug into her identity. He discovered the woman’s name, Karen Shaw, and learned that she is a veteran activist who has been spotted at <strong>nearly a hundred different protests</strong> over the years:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}. In other words, she is not a random New Yorker outraged by current events, but rather what Friedman calls a “professional protester.”</p> <p>Shaw is affiliated with a New York City direct-action group called <strong>Rise and Resist</strong>, and reportedly even admitted that working as a protest organizer is her job:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}. Evidence of her prolific track record is compelling – as Friedman documented, she has appeared at countless rallies spanning various causes, from anti-Trump marches to anti-Israel demonstrations. At the Iran rally, Shaw donned a neon vest and acted as a self-appointed marshal, confronting Friedman and attempting to control the narrative. Her interference was caught on camera, and it was only later that her extensive protest résumé came to light.</p> <p>Crucially, Shaw’s presence suggests that the Iran protest was not entirely organic. Instead, at least some participants were part of an orchestrated activist network that regularly seeds protests with trained demonstrators. Friedman has described this phenomenon as a <em>“paid protesters’ mob”</em> – essentially, an industry of repeat protesters who lend manpower and coordination to multiple movements. The implication is that large-scale protests can be, in part, manufactured: driven by ideological organizations and their paid staff or volunteers, rather than spontaneously arising from the grassroots. Shaw’s case is a vivid example of how protest events may be engineered and amplified by a cadre of perennial activists.</p> </details> <details id="funding"> <summary>Funding and Organization of Protests</summary> <p>The discovery of a professional protester like Karen Shaw naturally raises the question: <em>who funds and organizes these recurring demonstrations?</em> In this case, Shaw’s group, Rise and Resist, is a registered 501(c) nonprofit that plays a key role in New York’s activist scene. Notably, Rise and Resist (along with many similar left-wing organizations) uses the platform <strong>ActBlue</strong> to raise money:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}. ActBlue is the Democratic Party’s premier fundraising PAC and online donation processor:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}. For every dollar contributed through ActBlue, the platform takes a roughly 4% cut in fees – an amount that quickly adds up given ActBlue has processed billions of dollars in contributions:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}. This fundraising machine is fueled by deep-pocketed progressive donors; as an example, ActBlue’s major benefactors include billionaire activists like George Soros and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}.</p> <p>How does this relate to street protests? It turns out ActBlue doesn’t just fund election campaigns – it also serves as the financial artery for many activist groups behind demonstrations. In fact, ActBlue has been linked to numerous protest movements in recent years. Elon Musk, reacting to vandalism at Tesla showrooms by protest groups, pointed out that at least <em>five activist organizations (including Rise &amp; Resist, the Disruption Project, Indivisible, and DSA)</em> behind the anti-Tesla protests were fundraising via ActBlue:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}. Reports confirm that these ActBlue-funded groups actively promote and organize protests, some of which have led to arrests for disorderly conduct and property damage:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}. ActBlue’s connection to such disruptive protest politics has drawn scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}, though it often flies under the media radar. In the context of the Iran rally, the implication is that groups like Rise and Resist can mobilize resources (travel stipends, printed signs, coordination staff, etc.) using donated funds, thereby injecting professional organization into what might appear to be spontaneous protests.</p> <p>The coordination and financing behind the “Solidarity with Iran” demonstration were evident. The event did not materialize out of thin air; it was promoted by an alliance of socialist and pro-Palestinian groups (sometimes under names like the “Bronx Anti-War Coalition”) and bolstered by activists with institutional backing:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}. In New York, Rise and Resist members like Shaw have been heavily involved in planning major protests – for example, acting as volunteer marshals during the nationwide “No Kings” anti-Trump rallies:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}. Such roles are typically supported by training and funding from nonprofit organizations. Simply put, there is an entire infrastructure that underpins these mass mobilizations: nonprofit advocacy groups, fundraising platforms, and paid organizers working in tandem. What may seem to be a crowd of concerned citizens with homemade signs can, upon closer inspection, also include paid organizers, pre-printed banners, and resources supplied by national activist networks.</p> </details> <details id="conclusion"> <summary>Conclusion</summary> <p>The investigation into the New York Iran rally lays bare a two-fold truth: first, that extremist antisemitic ideology is increasingly masquerading as legitimate “protest” in the heart of Western cities, and second, that many of these protests are turbocharged by professional activism and organized funding. Far from isolated outbursts, these demonstrations are part of what Friedman and others describe as an <strong>“organized global movement”</strong> using popular causes as a <em>Trojan horse</em> for promoting hatred and even violence:contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}. Protesters at the rally freely called for Israel’s annihilation – a spectacle that represents not just a moral outrage, but a dire warning sign:contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}. When genocidal chants of “burn Tel Aviv” ring out in Times Square and ordinary onlookers turn out to be seasoned agitators on a donor-funded payroll, it is clear that something profoundly concerning is afoot.</p> <p>This case study highlights the need for greater scrutiny of both the messages and the messengers in such protests. The antisemitic incitement witnessed should force communities and authorities to confront the line between protected political speech and dangerous hate speech. At the same time, recognizing the presence of a well-resourced protest industry prompts us to ask: <em>Who is pulling the strings?</em> Understanding the networks of nonprofits, fundraising platforms, and career activists behind these events can help separate genuine grassroots sentiment from manufactured outrage. As Friedman’s exposé shows, ignoring these factors would be perilous. The events in New York were not an anomaly, but rather a microcosm of a broader phenomenon in which extremist agendas and organized activism converge. A clear-eyed response – one that addresses both the hateful ideologies on display and the infrastructure enabling their spread – is urgently warranted in the face of this orchestrated “people’s protest” theater.</p> </details> </article> <!-- References (the sources are cited in text above as clickable links) --> <p><small><strong>Sources:</strong> All source citations above (e.g., :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}) are clickable and reference the original reports or documents that informed this investigation.

A recent demonstration in Manhattan, documented by independent journalist Nate Friedman, made this terrifying reality all too clear. In a searing exposé – <strong><em>“I Exposed Iran ‘Protestors’”</em></strong> – published online, Friedman captured raw, unfiltered conversations with participants at the pro-Tehran regime rally amid the growing Israel-Iran conflic:contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33}】. His on-the-ground interviews would reveal not only extreme rhetoric from the demonstrators, but also evidence that some of those in the crowd were organized, repeat agitators rather than ordinary grassroots protesters.</p> <p>Friedman’s investigation builds on earlier efforts to expose such professional activists infiltrating protests. In this report, we summarize the key findings of his latest exposé: first, the extreme anti-Israel and pro-terror sentiments openly expressed by rally-goers; and second, the role of a coordinated “protest machine” in driving and amplifying the event. These findings raise serious questions about the true nature of these ostensibly spontaneous protests and who is really pulling the strings. Far from a simple gathering of concerned citizens, the New York rally appears to have been both a platform for radical ideology and a stage managed by seasoned operatives in the protest industry.</p> </details> <details id="antisemitism"> <summary>Antisemitic Rhetoric at the Protest</summary> <p>Friedman’s footage reveals that what was framed as an anti-war or “pro-Iran” rally quickly descended into unabashed calls for violence against Israel and praise for militant groups.

She then doubles down, declaring that she is “thrilled” by Iran’s regime because it is “the only country that stands up to Israel and will hopefully destroy it”<a href="https://combatantisemitism.org/cam-news/video-expose-reveals-the-antisemitic-hatred-driving-pro-iran-protestors-in-new-york-city/" target="_blank":contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35}】</a>.

The rally even featured members of Neturei Karta (a fringe ultra-Orthodox sect that opposes Israel’s existence) holding signs in support of Iran. Far from a peaceful anti-war demonstration, the event became an outlet for extremist rhetoric indistinguishable from the Iranian regime’s own propaganda.</p> <p>Notably, protesters on American soil felt free to call for the literal annihilation of a U.S. ally. That individuals could stand in New York City and openly cheer the idea of Israel’s destruction – while excusing or even celebrating mass murder – is more than a shocking display of hatred. As one analysis warned, it represents a dangerous moral failure and a warning sign that should not be ignored<a href="https://combatantisemitism.org/cam-news/video-expose-reveals-the-antisemitic-hatred-driving-pro-iran-protestors-in-new-york-city/" target="_blank":contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}】</a>. In short, the protest’s anti-Israel activism served as a thin veil for virulent antisemitism and the glorification of terrorism. This phenomenon underscores how quickly legitimate political discourse can be hijacked by those peddling violent bigotry under the guise of “resistance.”</p> </details> <details id="protesters"> <summary>Professional Protesters Exposed</summary> <p>Beyond the content of the protesters’ chants and slogans, Friedman’s investigation uncovered something equally insidious: the presence of professional agitators who travel from rally to rally.

He discovered the woman’s name, Karen Shaw, and learned that she is a veteran activist who has been spotted at <strong>nearly 100 different protests</strong> over the years<a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/currenteventsii/inside-america-s-protest-machine-who-s-funding-the-t38756-s30.html" target="_blank":contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}】</a>. In other words, she is not a random local outraged by this issue, but rather what Friedman calls a “professional protester.”</p> <p>Shaw is affiliated with a New York City direct-action group called <strong>Rise and Resist</strong>, and she reportedly even <em>admitted</em> that working as a protest organizer is her job<a href="https://twitter.com/Traylyt/status/1935105717092106551" target="_blank":contentReference[oaicite:40]{index=40}】</a><a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/currenteventsii/inside-america-s-protest-machine-who-s-funding-the-t38756-s30.html" target="_blank":contentReference[oaicite:41]{index=41}】</a>. Video from the event shows Shaw (wearing a neon protest marshal vest) attempting to corral the crowd and block Friedman’s camera, acting very much in an official capacity. Her extensive protest résumé – spanning causes from anti-police demonstrations to environmental and anti-Trump rallies – strongly suggests that her involvement in the Iran rally was part of a coordinated activist effort rather than spontaneous participation. In fact, Friedman identified several other familiar faces in the crowd, indicating that a network of repeat demonstrators was present.</p> <p>Shaw’s case highlights the existence of an organized “protest industry” operating behind the scenes. These are people who make a career (or at least a regular practice) out of protests, traveling city to city to lend their voices and logistical support. Friedman has described it as a <em>“paid protesters’ mob”</em> – essentially a cadre of perennial activists who can be counted on to show up and agitate for various causes. The implication is that some large protests are in part manufactured: they are planned and bolstered by experienced organizers and paid staffers, rather than arising solely from grassroots energy. What might appear on TV as a spontaneous outpouring of citizen anger may actually be, to some degree, choreographed by professional protesters and the groups that deploy them.</p> </details> <details id="funding"> <summary>Funding and Organization of Protests</summary> <p>The discovery of a professional protester like Karen Shaw naturally raises the question: <em>who funds and coordinates these recurring demonstrations?</em> In this case, Shaw’s organization, Rise and Resist, is a registered 501(c)(4) nonprofit that plays a key role in New York’s activist scene.

It turns out ActBlue doesn’t just fund election campaigns – it also serves as a financial artery for many activist groups behind demonstrations.

Reports confirm that these ActBlue-funded groups have been actively promoting and organizing such protests – some of which resulted in activists being <strong>arrested</strong> on charges like vandalism and disorderly conduct<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/investigations/3346896/how-actblue-makes-money-off-protestors/" target="_blank":contentReference[oaicite:47]{index=47}】</a>. ActBlue’s link to militant protest activity is nothing new, but much of it has gone underreported. The platform’s involvement in funding bail funds for rioters and facilitating pro-Palestinian campus occupations, for instance, has drawn criticism and scrutiny from lawmaker:contentReference[oaicite:48]{index=48}】. In short, ActBlue provides the financial infrastructure that can help turn local protests into sustained movements.</p> <p>The coordination behind the “Solidarity with Iran” rally in New York was evident. The event did not materialize out of thin air; it was promoted by an alliance of socialist and pro-Palestinian groups (identified in one report as the “Bronx Anti-Iran coalition”) that called for supporters to hit the streets<a href="https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-858103" target="_blank":contentReference[oaicite:49]{index=49}】</a>. On the ground, experienced organizers like Shaw were present to guide the protest. In fact, members of Rise and Resist had been preparing for that day as part of the broader “No Kings” nationwide demonstrations against President Trump’s policies. Rise and Resist volunteers served as marshals and safety coordinators during the massive anti-Trump marches in New York, receiving special training in de-escalation tactics to keep those protests orderly<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/06/13/no-kings-protest-anti-trump-army-parade/" target="_blank":contentReference[oaicite:50]{index=50}】</a><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/06/13/no-kings-protest-anti-trump-army-parade/" target="_blank":contentReference[oaicite:51]{index=51}】</a>. That same organizational know-how was brought to the Iran rally. In other words, behind the scenes were seasoned activists, nonprofit resources, and a well-honed strategy – all working together to orchestrate what appeared to be a spontaneous outpouring of public sentiment. The result is a protest that, while genuine in the passion of many attendees, is also partly a scripted production enabled by political organizations and their donors.</p> </details> <details id="conclusion"> <summary>Conclusion</summary> <p>The investigation into the New York Iran rally lays bare a two-fold truth: first, that extremist antisemitic ideology is increasingly masquerading as legitimate “protest” in the heart of Western cities, and second, that many of these protests are turbocharged by professional activism and organized funding. Far from an isolated incident, this rally was part of what Friedman and others describe as an organized global movement using popular causes as a <em>Trojan horse</em> for promoting hatred, justifying terror, and eroding historical truth<a href="https://combatantisemitism.org/cam-news/video-expose-reveals-the-antisemitic-hatred-driving-pro-iran-protestors-in-new-york-city/" target="_blank":contentReference[oaicite:52]{index=52}】</a>. Protesters in Times Square freely called for Israel’s annihilation – a demand that is not merely shocking, but one that should ring alarm bells. It highlights a radicalization that we ignore at our peril<a href="https://combatantisemitism.org/cam-news/video-expose-reveals-the-antisemitic-hatred-driving-pro-iran-protestors-in-new-york-city/" target="_blank":contentReference[oaicite:53]{index=53}】</a>. When chants of “burn Tel Aviv to the ground” can echo in New York, and when seasoned agitators can steer demonstrations from behind the scenes, it becomes clear that these are not normal times.</p> <p>This case study underscores the need for greater awareness of both the messages and the messengers in contemporary protest movements. The blatant antisemitism on display should prompt leaders and communities to denounce hate unequivocally and ensure that legitimate political discourse is not hijacked by those inciting violence. At the same time, the revelation of a well-funded protest apparatus urges us to follow the money and organizational links behind such events. Only by understanding who is coordinating and bankrolling these rallies can we differentiate genuine grassroots outrage from manufactured theater. Friedman’s exposé provides a window into this hidden side of activism – a world where ideological fervor meets strategic planning and outside financing. In the end, shining a light on these dynamics is crucial: it helps inoculate the public against manipulation, and it affirms that while the right to protest must be protected, so too must our vigilance against those who would exploit that right to spread hate or chaos under a false flag of social justice.</p> </details> </article> <p><small><strong>Sources:</strong> All source citations above (e.g., <a href="https://combatantisemitism.org/cam-news/video-expose-reveals-the-antisemitic-hatred-driving-pro-iran-protestors-in-new-york-city/" target="_blank":contentReference[oaicite:54]{index=54}】</a>) are clickable and reference the original materials that informed this investigation.
