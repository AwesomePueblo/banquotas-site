    <h2>The Transcript</h2>
    <p>
      Thank you for clarifying. I will now dig into the individuals and money ties revealed in the video, investigate any suggested underground networks or manipulations, and examine whether there is credible evidence supporting deeper conspiracies. I’ll focus on uncovering connections, verifying claims, and exposing any hidden agendas driving the narrative.

I’ll get back to you soon with a detailed analysis of what I find.


# Investigation into *“I Exposed More Iran ‘Protestors’”* Video

## Background of the Video and Protest

The YouTube video in question (titled *“I Exposed More Iran ‘Protestors’”* by independent journalist Nate Friedman) documents a recent protest in New York City where demonstrators expressed support for Iran’s regime and opposition to Israel and former President Trump. The rally took place amid rising tensions in the Middle East – described as a *“pro-Tehran regime rally”* – and featured extreme anti-Israel rhetoric. For example, one protestor openly voiced a desire to see Israel *“destroyed”* and praised Iran as *“the only country that stands up to Israel”*, even justifying Hamas’s October 7, 2024 terror attack as legitimate “resistance”. This sets the stage for the video’s investigation: Friedman not only interviews participants about their views, but also **exposes that some of these protesters are not random concerned citizens but rather *professional activists* connected to organized groups**.

## Key Individuals and Organizations Identified

The video reveals that several individuals at the rally are linked to established activist organizations, suggesting an orchestrated effort rather than a spontaneous gathering. One particularly noteworthy figure exposed is **David Chung**. On camera, Chung was presenting himself as a typical anti-Trump, pro-Iran protestor – but Friedman discovered he is in fact the General Manager of **The People’s Forum**, a prominent far-left activist hub in Manhattan. The People’s Forum is a nonprofit community organization that champions anti-war, anti-imperialist causes. According to mainstream reports, David Chung has long been an organizer with The People’s Forum and has helped lead multiple protests in New York. For instance, he coordinated a large “No ICE Raids” immigration protest in Foley Square on June 10, 2025, where he was quoted as an organizer for The People’s Forum. In late 2023 and 2024, Chung also helped lead several anti-Israel rallies in NYC in his capacity at The People’s Forum. This pattern shows that Chung is **not a spontaneous grassroots protestor but a paid activist whose job is organizing demonstrations**.

In the video, Friedman confronts Chung (and possibly others) about their affiliations. The fact that a *leader* of an activist organization was participating without disclosing his role hints at a *hidden coordination*. The People’s Forum was likely one of the groups behind the “No War on Iran” rally – indeed, the organization had previously advertised protests framing *“U.S. imperialism and Zionism”* as the real threats in the Middle East, not Iran. The presence of its general manager on the ground underscores that **established activist networks were driving the event**.

It’s worth noting that The People’s Forum was not alone. Other organizations and networks were likely involved or allied. Reporting by the Jerusalem Post and others shows that The People’s Forum often partners with groups like the **ANSWER Coalition** (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism) and the **International People’s Assembly** in coordinating protests. These groups form a coalition that convened major rallies (for example, the “Shut It Down for Palestine” protests after October 7, 2024). They share overlapping leadership and ideologies, suggesting a **web of professional activists** who appear across multiple causes. Many are associated with the far-left **Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL)** or its allies. *(Indeed, ANSWER is essentially a front for PSL, and PSL leaders like Brian Becker and Claudia De La Cruz have been involved in these protests.)* In short, the video’s “random protesters” turn out to be part of an **organized activist infrastructure** in New York.

## Connections to Wealth and Financial Influence

Crucially, these activist organizations and individuals are tied to significant **financial backing and wealthy benefactors**, which hints at an *underground network* influencing their activities. The People’s Forum – the group led by David Chung – provides a striking example. Investigations have revealed that The People’s Forum is linked to a **covert funding network spearheaded by Neville Roy Singham**, a millionaire socialist activist with close ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Singham has poured *tens of millions of dollars* into left-wing causes around the world, funneling money through opaque nonprofit pathways. In fact, The People’s Forum openly admitted in 2021 that it was funded by this “Marxist comrade” Singham. According to a May 2024 report by the Network Contagion Research Institute, hundreds of millions of dollars have been channeled by Singham into advocacy groups promoting pro-China and anti-Western narratives.

One conduit for this money was the **Goldman Sachs Philanthropy Fund (GSPF)**, a donor-advised fund that can obscure the origin of donations. Through GSPF, roughly \$20 million was directed (2017–2022) to a nonprofit called the **Justice and Education Fund (JEF)**. JEF, in turn, granted at least \$64,500 to The People’s Forum. Notably, **David Chung himself sits on the board of the Justice and Education Fund** (along with The People’s Forum’s co-founder Manolo De Los Santos). In other words, Chung was **directly involved in managing funds that flowed from a multimillion-dollar pool into The People’s Forum’s coffers**. Those funds are also linked to other controversial outlets – for example, JEF paid \$2.3 million to a CCP propaganda firm (Shanghai Maku) and \$2.9 million to *NewsClick*, an India-based media site that was raided by authorities for receiving illegal Chinese money. This intricate financing suggests a **hidden agenda of foreign influence**: money with CCP ties was supporting U.S. activist groups rallying in support of Iran and against U.S./Israeli policies.

The **financial manipulation** becomes even clearer looking at The People’s Forum’s recent financials. Tax filings show that The People’s Forum’s revenue **skyrocketed from about \$487,000 in 2021 to \$4.4 million in 2022** – an 803% jump. This enormous spike coincides with the influx of money from Singham-linked sources. A U.S. House Ways and Means Committee hearing in late 2023 even scrutinized such foreign funding of nonprofits. Lawmakers noted that foreign money (particularly from China) might be *“meddling in our politics”* through these charitable fronts. David Chung was asked by journalists about the source of The People’s Forum’s sudden millions, but he declined to comment. The lack of transparency raises red flags that **wealthy patrons behind the scenes are bankrolling these protests to advance specific geopolitical narratives**.

It’s important to emphasize that funding activism is not illegal per se; many causes have donors. However, in this case the donors and amounts are *concealed* in a way that obscures their origin, pointing to a deliberate manipulation of the public narrative. Singham – who lives in Shanghai and has worked with CCP entities – has been described as a *“socialist benefactor of far-left causes”* who uses his fortune to propagate Beijing-friendly messaging. His wife, Jodie Evans (co-founder of CodePink), sits on The People’s Forum’s board and likewise has promoted pro-CCP and anti-Israel activism. These wealthy influencers effectively underwrite protests like the one in New York, paying organizers, renting venues, and mobilizing supporters. **Thus, behind the youthful protesters chanting in the street lies a money trail leading to an elite network of ideological financiers.**

## Hidden Agendas and Networks Exposed

The evidence above reveals a pattern of systemic coordination and influence that goes far beyond this single rally. What might look like an organic gathering of outraged citizens is, in reality, **the product of established networks with hidden agendas**. One clear agenda is to promote an anti-American, anti-Israel narrative aligned with authoritarian regimes that oppose the U.S.

For instance, The People’s Forum explicitly pushes pro-CCP viewpoints: it has *hailed China’s “new era led by Xi Jinping”* and hosted events praising China’s *“revolutionary struggle”*. It even platformed a speaker who justified China’s repression of Uyghur Muslims, and amplified Chinese propaganda collectives on U.S. soil. In late 2023, as war raged between Israel and Hamas, The People’s Forum helped organize **Hamas-sympathetic protests** across the U.S., calling for “ceasefire” but also featuring blatant antisemitism. The group reposted a video of PFLP terrorist Leila Khaled extolling *“the resistance of the Palestinian people”*, and promoted a “March for the Martyrs” rally in NYC glorifying those fighting Israel. All of these actions serve a *deceptive narrative*: under the banner of “peace” or “anti-war” activism, these networks are **actually whitewashing or supporting extremist violence and authoritarian regimes** (Iran’s theocracy, Hamas, the CCP, etc.). The true agenda – as the video suggests – is **not simply anti-war principle, but a one-sided alignment against Western democracies and in favor of America’s adversaries**.

These groups often coordinate under umbrella coalitions, giving a false impression of broad grassroots momentum. In reality, the **same core activists and organizations reappear across issues**, essentially a *rent-a-mob*. For example, the “No War on Iran” protest featured People’s Forum personnel who only weeks earlier were leading “Abolish ICE” immigration rallies and, before that, pro-Palestine marches. The ANSWER Coalition – another organizer in many anti-Israel and anti-US protests – is tied into this network via a nonprofit called **Progress Unity Fund**, which quietly finances it. Notably, Progress Unity Fund’s officials have included individuals charged with acting as agents of the Chinese government (one board member, **Henry Liang**, was *arrested for hiding his work for Beijing* while involved in a “Pivot to Peace” group that the network sponsored). This illustrates a *deceptive element*: foreign authoritarian interests (like the CCP) are **literally guiding and funding some of the activism**, all while the front-line protesters claim to be motivated by human rights or “peace.”

Another layer of hidden coordination is the collaboration with extremist organizations. In New York’s activist scene, groups such as **Within Our Lifetime (WOL)** and **Samidoun** (a Palestinian militant-linked network) frequently join forces with The People’s Forum and ANSWER. WOL, led by Nerdeen Kiswani, has staged some of NYC’s most aggressive anti-Israel demonstrations and openly echoes Hamas propaganda – it is known to coordinate closely with the above networks. Samidoun, for its part, is a proxy of the PFLP terror group and has been caught providing signs and slogans at these protests. These alliances are not immediately apparent to a casual observer at a rally. **They form an underground coalition that steers the messaging and tone of protests toward radical, even violent, directions under the guise of social justice.** When the video host Friedman “exposed” the protesters, he was peeling back this guise – revealing that a seemingly grassroots rally was *embedded in a larger pattern of systemic deception and control*.

## Verifying Conspiracy vs. Reality

The claims of “paid protesters” or a conspiracy of elites orchestrating protests often circulate online. This investigation finds that **there is a substantial kernel of truth to these claims**, though with nuances:

* **Professional Activists:** It is true that some individuals at the Iran protest are essentially *professional activists* – they draw salaries or stipends from nonprofits whose mission is to organize protests. David Chung is a prime example, as a salaried manager of an activist nonprofit who appears at demonstrations regularly. While these activists are ideologically committed, their consistent presence and cross-issue involvement suggest coordinated deployment rather than spontaneous passion. In that sense, the “protesters” were indeed **planted or pre-planned by organizations**. It’s not a random slice of the public.
* **Funding Networks:** The notion of shadowy funding behind protests is **borne out by evidence**. We can confirm that large sums of money from wealthy donors (Neville Roy Singham and related funds) have been funneled into organizing anti-Israel, anti-America demonstrations. This is not mere conjecture – financial documents and investigations by reputable sources (New York Times, Jerusalem Post, Washington Examiner) substantiate these money flows. The agenda of these donors (promoting CCP-friendly and anti-West narratives) aligns with the protest messages, indicating *intentional influence operations*.
* **Foreign Influence:** Another “conspiracy” claim is that foreign governments (like China or Iran) are behind American protests. Here the truth is **partly confirmed**: We see clear CCP-linked influence via the Singham network and groups like Pivot to Peace (with a Chinese agent involved) in the activist sphere. There isn’t direct evidence that the Iranian regime itself organized the NYC rally; however, the protest’s aims *did* serve Iran’s interests (opposing U.S./Israeli pressure on Tehran). It appears more that **domestic far-left networks, bolstered by CCP-linked funds, took up Iran’s cause as part of their broader anti-U.S. agenda**. In short, a confluence of interests rather than a top-down order from Tehran. But the CCP connection is real and documented.
* **Paid Crowds vs. Paid Organizers:** It’s important to differentiate: while the **organizers and core agitators** are funded, there is no solid proof that every individual in the crowd was directly paid cash to attend. Many rank-and-file protesters likely share the ideology or were mobilized through social media and community groups. The *idea of protest actors being handed envelopes of money* (a common Internet rumor) was **not explicitly evidenced** in this case. What we do have is a structure where organizers use nonprofit money to arrange transportation, banners, and media, and to rally their members. So, the *deception* is more about **astroturfing** (manufacturing the appearance of grassroots sentiment) rather than literally hiring random mercenaries. The result, however, is similar – the protest is choreographed by those with resources and a script.

## Patterns of Systemic Control and Deception

From the above, a pattern emerges of how **systemic control** is exercised over such protests:

1. **Ideological Networks:** A set of interconnected organizations (People’s Forum, ANSWER/PSL, CodePink, WOL, etc.) share leaders and goals. They coordinate to rapidly respond to political events with protests. This network operates almost like a *“protest industry,”* ready to deploy as needed. It gives the same few dozen activists outsized influence by multiplying their presence across issues.
2. **Concealed Funding:** The network is sustained by a hidden pipeline of funding. Wealthy ideologues (like Singham) and possibly foreign actors channel money through trusts and nonprofits that mask the donor identities. This **dark money** enables full-time activism (covering staff salaries like Chung’s, renting venues like The People’s Forum space, printing thousands of signs, etc.). Unknowing onlookers see the slogans and crowds but not the dollars spent to put them there.
3. **Messaging and Agendas:** There is a deceptive uniformity in messaging that suggests central planning. The slogans at the Iran rally (blaming “U.S. imperialism and Zionism” for Middle East chaos) mirror the talking points promoted by The People’s Forum and its allies online. The **agenda is to shift blame away from regimes like Iran or China, and onto Western governments**. Protesters often repeat these points verbatim, indicating they’ve been disseminated through workshops or literature by the organizers. It’s a form of **narrative control**, dressed up as grassroots outrage.
4. **Camouflage of Extremism:** The network also **camouflages extremist alliances**. By operating under benign names (“peace”, “justice”, “anti-war”), they downplay links to violent groups. For example, marchers might not realize that a group like Samidoun handing out flyers is officially a terrorist-designated entity. The systemic deception is that of *omission*: the organizers do not transparently announce, “This protest is coordinated by groups funded by a pro-CCP millionaire and in league with PFLP operatives.” Instead, they use inclusive slogans about “peace” to attract well-meaning people, effectively laundering the credibility of regular protesters to further a radical agenda.
5. **Repeat Appearances:** Finally, there’s a pattern of the *same figures* and groups showing up repeatedly, which is itself a telltale sign of coordination. Over just a few weeks in 2025, David Chung and The People’s Forum popped up in immigration protests, anti-Israel rallies, and now pro-Iran events. The **systemic control** here is that a small cadre can steer multiple protest movements, giving the illusion of a broad, spontaneous uprising each time. It’s a rotating cast directed by the same “producers” behind the scenes.

## Conclusion

The deep investigation into the *“I Exposed More Iran ‘Protestors’”* video confirms that **many conspiratorial-sounding claims are grounded in reality**. The individuals and organizations highlighted in the video are indeed connected to wealth and influence that operate out of public view. A network of activist organizations – led by figures like David Chung – has access to **millions of dollars funneled through opaque channels**. This money, traced back to donors with agendas (in this case a socialist billionaire aligned with China), finances a coordinated machinery for street protests. What appears to be a grassroots demonstration for justice was, in large part, **strategically engineered**.

Furthermore, the investigation uncovered **underground links** between these protest organizers and foreign authoritarian interests. Through fronts like The People’s Forum, *CCP-linked operatives have effectively injected propaganda and influence into American protest movements*. The agenda is to weaken support for U.S. policies (whether it’s sanctioning Iran, enforcing immigration law, or backing Israel) by framing them as evil – while sanitizing the image of regimes like Iran’s. In pursuing this agenda, the network has not hesitated to partner with designated extremists and to engage in historical revisionism (e.g. glorifying terrorist acts).

Critically, **true and provable connections** back up these assertions: IRS filings, congressional inquiries, reputable journalism, and even admissions by those involved all point to a real constellation of money and power behind the protests. This is not a baseless “Illuminati” theory but a documented example of how **systemic deception** can operate in modern activism. While not every protester on the street is knowingly part of a conspiracy, the **framework directing them** is very much deliberate and funded from the top. By shining light on figures like David Chung and networks like The People’s Forum, the video – and this analysis – helps **expose the patterns of control** that typically remain hidden behind placards and chants.
